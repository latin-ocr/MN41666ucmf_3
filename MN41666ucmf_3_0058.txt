the mould ol Greek philosophie thought: the end deter-
mines the beginningJ the δι’ ὅν involves the ἐξ οὗ or in
other words the idea ol Christ as the ἁρχὴ πάσης κτίσεως
(Apoc. iii 14); and we are carried from soteriology into
the sphere ol cosmology. But it is otherwise in the
Johannine writings: in which ‘apart from the Prologue,
a separation of πνεῦμα (λόγος) and σάρξ in Christ is not
presupposed: it is always the whole Personality to whom
everything exalted appliest’ For, as Harnach conceives,
this Hellenizing of Christian dogma was arrested in
Church reaching hythe intluence oi the Monarchians‚
of Athanasius, and of Blhlical passages which pointed in
another direction.

Against this theory ol the evolution of the dogma of
the pre-existence ol the Second Person it may be urged:
(a) That, except in the Johannine Prologue and
St Paul’s speeches at Athens and at Lystra there is
very little indeed in N,T. theology which suggests the
‘acute Hellenisation' on which such stress is laid by
Harnach. We might expect it in the Pauline Epistles,
but we do not find ir, whereas we do lind expressions

 

which remind us of Tertullian's ‘quid simile philosophus ¹

et Christianusi'2 (bl lt cannot be said that the N.T.
contains a single theological treatise. The words of
Harnack, just quoted, on the Johannine idea of ‘the
Whole Christ,¹ may be set against his treatment of the

historical Person of Jesus. We must not expect to lind ’

a reasoned system and a clear-cut'terminology in the
NT„ any more than we can expect to find grammar
before language and logic before thought. Men wrote

1 And therefore, according ro Harnach‚ ‘lor the original readers¹ if
they 'ruere educated Greeks, the Prologue must have been more intelligible¹
than the suceeeding narrative. “ ’
