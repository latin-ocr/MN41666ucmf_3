XXX INTKODUCTION

as ‘the Lord‚' ‘the Son of God,’ ‘our Saviour‚' ‘the
Master,' and to await His speedy retum in glory. The
Gnostic heresies, which threatened the adulteration of
Christianity with a fantastic philosophy, compelled
Christian thinkers to find some more satissying formula ;
or rather, sent them back to the N ew Testament to find
the elements of such aformula in the Johannine doctrine
of the Logos. The like may be said of the Catholic
¹reply to the Ebionite teaching⁷ which reduced our Lord
to the place of a second Moses. Ar the beginning of the
third century two tenderrcies of thought were apparent:
the Humanitarian view'of Christ, which is represented i
by the ‘rationalistic Monarchians' (better named
‘Adoptianists' as holding that Jesus Christ uras merely
the adopted Son of the Fatherl, who received Divine
δύναμις at His baptism); and the view of the Modalist
Monarchians, of whom Sabellius was the best-known
representative. As against the former, it was necessary
to establish His equality with the Fatherl. As against
the latter, with whom the Patripassians³ are to be classed,
it was necessary to establish the distinction of Persons in
the Trinity. This could nothe done without a careful Ἰ

3 The Patripassians denied the distinct Personality of the Son. Chief
among them were Praxeas and Noeris, both iavoured by the Popes of their ’
day, Victor and Callistus. Praxeas taught that the Father became man and
suffered in Jesus Christ: ‘ipsum patrem descendisse in uirginem, ipsum en
ea natum, ipsum passum, denique ipsum esse Iesum Christum’ (Tertull. adu.
Praxean i). The Patripassians may he called ‘modalistic Monarchians':
i.e. they insisted on the Unity ot the Godhead to this extent, that they
represented the Trinity as denoting three ‘modes' of manifestation, not
Three Persons in the Godhead. We have a further development in the

teaching of Sahellius.
