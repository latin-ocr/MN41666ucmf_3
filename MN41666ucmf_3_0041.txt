hereticsJ ‘who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit,⁷ had

¹ hawked the Libellus de T raritate of Tertullian about
the streets of Constantinople at a small price, having
incorporated it with the Epistles of Cyprian, whose
authority they wished to claim for their heresy. lerome
pronounces this a twofold falsehood saying that the
work is neither Cyprian’s nor Tertullian's but Novatian's‚
‘euius et inscribitur titulo et auctoris eloquium styli
proprietas demonstrat1.'

Some perplexity has been created by Jerome's p
description ol the work as an epitome of a work of
Tertullian's. There is nothing in the writings oi the
latter except the aduersos Praxean which can come
into consideration: he has left no treatise de fatuitate.
And our treatise is distinctly longer than the adra.
Praxean, and also contains some thoughts which remind
us rather ol lrenaeus than of Tertullian².

The theory proposed by Mi J. Quarry that the J
dr T raritate is a translation srom a lost Greek original,
probably the work of Hippolytus against Artemon, finds
no supportent lt is amazing to find that scholar
speaking of ‘the very barbarous air of the work as a
Latin composition? As a writer Novatian can hold his
own with Tertullian or Cypriam enough has been said
alreadyt ol the independent merits of his style, as it
may be judgedtrom his acknowledged writings.
