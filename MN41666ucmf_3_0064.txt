would identify the Son with the Father‚ and this leads
him to contrast with the answer to Philip the blessing
pronounced on the pure of heart. How could Christ
promise what He had already bestowed? There must
be a future vision of God1. We are not told how this
is to be reconciled with the distinction which the writer
maintains in respect of invisibility, between the Father
and the Son: he does not even raise the point, but
perhaps he would find the reconciliation in the thought
of an inconceivable development of man’s spiritual
faculty, such as the words of c. xviii may imply
(gradatim enim et per incrementa fragilitas humana
nutriri debuit per imaginem ad istam gloriam, ut deum
patrem uidere possit aliquand02’). We may also refer
to what is said below (go) on the ‘Deitication of mant?
Something must also be said upon the obedience of
the Son, and it enters into Novatian's conception of
His Divinity. He is ‘oboediens patri qua filius⁴’; He
obeys and ever has obeyed the Father in all things¹⁵;
He holds the power over all things, but by the
consignment‘and sufferance of His Father (sed qua
traditam, sed qua concessam, sed qua a patre proprio
sibi indultamss’). The expression ‘famulus' in ch. κ’ is
another very strong assertion of this relationship of
subjection. In the exposition of the cardinal passage
(Philipp. ii 6), which we have in ch. xxii, he distinctly

³ It is instructive to compare the treatment of the same question b'y
Irenaeus (ada. anr. iv 34. 5, 7); thus he says, ‘horno etenim a se non
uidet deum. ille autem uolens uidetur ab hominihus, aquibus uult et
quando uult et quemadmodum uult...uisus quidem tunc per spiritum pro-
phetice, uisus autern per filium adoptiue, uidebitur autern etin regno
caelorum paternaliter!
