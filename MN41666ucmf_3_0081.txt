usage, it occurred to Tertullian as the best term for his
purpose: he conceiyes Almighty God as the ‘tota sub-
stantia’ from whom proceed ‘officiales’ to administer
His Monarchy. Thus it indicated essential distinctions
in the Godhead (and particularly in Its operations),
which such a word as spectes could not have done with-

³ Mr Bethune·Baker (tc. p. 73) thinks that Hippolytus uses the term
asa rendering of ‘persona' which he must have found in familiar use
at Rome, where probably he learnt his theology.
