of· this world and yet of this world1.’ The Scripture
argument on which Novatian entirely relies is as strong
in delence of Christ’s Manhood as of His Godheadt
¹ It is when we come to examine Novatian’s treatment
'of the Humanity ot our Lord that we find ourselves in
considerable perplexity. What does he understand by
‘homo’? There are passages which would tempt us to
suppose that he identifies it with ‘caro’ the corporeal
nature. Ammundsen maintains that Christ is set in con·
trast with ‘ceteri homines' who are ‘non caro tantum

sed caro et anima³‚’ for that in Him the ‘Verbum dei’ ’

answers to ‘anima' in other men, We may compare
the application of Genesis xlix 11 in ch. xxi: the
Flesh is the ‘germem' and the Body the ‘vesture’ put
on by the Word of God at the Nativity, cleansed by
the Pession, put off at the Death, and resumed at the
Resurrection ‘By this substance, received that it might
be cleansed, the Humanity is expressed (“homo ex-
primitur'¹).’ From the operation of the Word N ovatian
infers the Deity of Christ: but he seems to forget for
the moment that the word ‘homo' includes a human
will and consciousness Was this also ‘put off ’ at death?
A similar criticism is applicable to the a fortiori argu-

ment from Christ's words ‘Fear not them which hill the
bodyt!

There are however other passages in the Treatise
which may modify our judgment. In ch. xxiv we find
the words ‘hominem filium hominis' explained in the
following line by ‘homo et caro et fragilis illa sub-
stantiat'3 and lower down, we have the expression ‘homo
