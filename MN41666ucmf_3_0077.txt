‘the thought that in place osa sin-ladon immortality
(i, p. 5, ll. 2-4)man comesto share the ‘Divine eternity'
of the Spirit through the obedience ol holiness (xxix,
p. 109. 11-p. 110. 1). lt is only sin which prevents
corruptible man from growing into the likeness of the
incorruptible1G0d. lt is the lncarnation through which
flesh, the seat of corruption, is brought into contact with
Deity, Christ being ‘mediator Dei et hominum‚' who in
Himself ‘ clasps into harmony things of earth and things
of heavent’ lt remains to add, that the whole argument
of chs. xiv, xv turns on the belief that mere man is not
and cannot conceivably become what Christ is: ‘since
man cannot do works like unto the heavenly works ol
God' (xiv, p. 47, l. 12).

Here Novatian leaves ns, having barely touched the
real problem of the kinship ol the human and Divine
through the clement called in the N.T. πνεῦμα. To
him the Divine generally appears as transcendent
rather than immanent³: a Power that enters ab extrem
and the reconciliation of the ‘Deus' and ‘homo’ in Christ
is but vaguely indicated. And similarly he asserts 'that
the will is free (i, p. 3. 15-pr 4. 8), but does not examine
the content of the idea.

. The question of the reconciliation of the human and
the Divine finds many answers in the course of human
thought. It may be said that the problem will always
elicit one of two types of solution: the one theocentric

and 'the other anthropocentric: in the former, God is ⁴

transcendent, above and outside His world, in the latter
