For this purpose it will be hest to enquire: first,

what Nova ian intends byt tshe s‘ormula Christus (leuel

which heis so zealous to defend13 and secondiy, what' tis
his concept ion os the Humanit ty of our Lorne, sor which
he constantly invokes the foundation-text, ‘Verbum
caro factum; andt 11111111γῇ m whatf torm does hestate
the union of the two nat ures, human and Divine‚in the
Personof fChrist?

i. We cannot examine the formula ‘Christus deus'

without first considering, what meaning Novatian gives ¹

to the simple idea'of Godhead, as expressed in the word
‘deus' He is mainly concerned to vindicate it against
the false notions of the Gnostic schools of thought on

the one side, and the Patripassians on the other; the
former setting a Demiurge or inferior God over against

the One God, the latter confusing the Father with the
Son. That is why he lays such stress on the Creative
and Providential action os the One God, who ‘contains
all things³,’ who transcends human thought and lan-
guaget. He is one, without an equal, and the Name
oi God is but a designation vouchsafed hy Him to
the human intelligence, which cannot grasp its contentl.
On the other hand, our conception ol God (‘ quicquid
esse potest quod deus ests ‘quicquid illud est totust')
must exclude all idea of human pasn '‚on physi cal and
menta tal of human ira lty and mor ahty of origin and
change⁸

What then is Novat' t’ians concept ion of Godhead, as

itis found' mt the Son? An examinat ion of his ex-
