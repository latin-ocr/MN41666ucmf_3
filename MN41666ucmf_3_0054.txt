ξ 4. Τίτε Pae-existence of alze Son of God.

A carefui stndy os the system of Praxeas as far as we .
can gather it froin Tertullian's treatise will shew that he
denied the pre-existence of the Son, in holding that God
. the Father became incarnato in the Person of Christ1,
⁹ in other words, that before the incarnation the Son had
no existence²‚ Even the Cathoiic writers who contro-
verted this Patripassian teaching base the Tri-personality
os God on the dairns of the work of redemption. The
Trinity is in danger oi becoming a rnere ‘oeconomy,' ,
as in the systems controverted³. The eternal existence
of the Logos in the Father is, in Tertullian, rather formal
‘ than real; for he can compare it With the existence of

unnttered speech in abumari mind, suggestive as an
illustration, but not an adequate parallel. Again, his
application of the words of Isaiah ‘ego'prirnus et in
supernentura ego surn' in connexion with St John’s ‘in
principio erat senno‚⁷ is this: that the Word was be-
gotten in the beginning (in principio protatus'), whereas
· the Father has no beginning (‘initiurn’), as being be-
gotten of none: and this ‘beginning' of the Word
Tertullian seerns to connect in that passage nith God's ¹
χ purpose of Creation. In fact in his desire to escape the
charge of ditheism‚ he approximates to that Gnostic
’ doctrine of Aeons, which at the beginning of tbe sanie
chapter he combatst. ¹
