IN TRODUCT ION XXXV

he said that his teaching contains an antidote to some ’
of our modern popular theology. The wide acceptance

of the ‘kenotic’ doctrine, though this doctrine by no
means implies humanitarian views, may encourage a
tendency to forget the other side of the truth as to
the Person of Christ. On the other hand, in regard to
the worship of Christ, Novatian is no less cautious than
’ the earliest Christians, whose prayers were almost always
offered to the Father through the Son, and their worship y s
to Jesus Christ in His whole Person, the Godhead in the i
Manhood.

lt is the characteristic of Christians that they ‘know
the Father' (1 Jo. ii 14). ln our Western indifference to
the finer distinctions of doctrine we have fallen into a
form of opinion, which sometimes can scarcely he dis-
tinguished from the Tritheism against which every pious
Jewish Christian would have sternly protested2, and
which has lent itself to transactional theories of the
Atonement. It is safest to keep the exact words of the
New Testament on this matter before our minds. While
Christ and the Father are One, He is the Only Way to
the Father. and as Christ reveals unto men the Father,
so the Spirit reveals unto menthe things of Christ. ln
proportion as the Church assimilates that revelation, she
is animated by the Living Spirit of Christ, and is herself
‘the extension of the incarnation' for the sake of the
world and indeed of the whole universe.
