implies that, though our Lord is ‘in the form of God‚’
it would haue been usurpation on His part to claim an
equality with God: far from doing so, at His nativity
He took the lorrnvof a slave. (Here we may refer to
what has been said in ᾗ 3 about the ‘subordination’ oi the
Son.) lt is not necessary to suppose thot the idea of
service and obedience (‘morigera oboedientia,‘ p. 120,
l. 18) carries with it, in Novatian’s rnind, that of an
essential inferiority of the Son, which such a phrase as
‘substantiae communio' definitely excludes¹. He would
no doubt have assented to Tertullian’s reference of the
‘unum sumus' of St John x 30 ‘ad dilectionem patris
’ qui filium diligit, et ad obsequium filii, qui uoluntati
patris obsequitur².' He attributes to the Son of God
the ‘natura dei' in the way of ornnipresence‚ and the
‘uirtus dei' and ‘uis diuinitatis³.’ But his position would
have been greatly strengthened had he grasped the
thought of ‘substantia’ in its later metaphysical sense.
It is just here that Novatian falls to provide a
doctrine of Christ¹s equality with the rather, which
shall give tobis sorrnula ‘Christus deus' its full content.
A good deal oi stress is laid upon the oneness of Father
and Son l‘ego et pater unum sumus,' not ‘unus'), but it
is a rnoral and practical unity, described in such ternis

as ‘concors patri suo deo inuentus,' ‘unum per concor·
diarn et per arnorern et per dilectionem: rather than
an essential unity. This is most apparent in the analogy
drawn frorn the reciproca] relation of Paul and Apollos⁵.
