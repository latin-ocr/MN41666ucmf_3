Though the treatise now bears on its· title-page the
theological term ‘Trinity,' this terrn occurs nowhere in
the text, as though the writer had intentionally avoided
it; for the word ‘Trinitas’ (Τριάς) occurs in Theophilus
oi Antioch Hippolytus, and Tertullian.
p The distribution oi the subject over the chapters
⁴ 2 indicates of itself that the predorninant question sor
the writer is the relation of our Lord to the Father
as it is conditioned hythe incarnation¹ and the union
¹ in Hirn of the two natures. The doctrine of the Holy
Ghost is so slightly handled, that certain heretics
ζ claimed the treatise in support os their own, views1.
³ Unquestionably Novatian never speaks oi Hirn as ‘tertia
Ἴ persona' or even as ‘deus’: he is content with the
¹3¹designations ‘spiritus sanctus,7 ‘paraclitus’ ‘spiritus
ueritatis,' and iu one place (c, xxix, p. 110, ΙΙ), ‘spiritus
dei? But the writer so enlarges on the operation of
the Holy Spirit in the soul and in the Church, as to
leave no doubt that he, no less than Tertullian, held
the doctrine oi His Personality'i

A strange dislocation of pages occurred in the arche-
type ΜΒ oi our ancient copies of this Treatise: by which v
the section beginning ‘eu quo manus' (end of ch. xiX,
page 73, first line) and ending with ‘sed filiurn compro-
basse’ (the last words of ch. xxvii, page 100, second Ἴ
line) was transposed so as to follow the words towards
the end of chapter xiv ‘illuc redit ubi prius iuit' (page .

47, line 28). Thus the old editions (such as that of
Pamelius) begin their ch. xxiii with ‘quod si de caelo,’
¹ and thus to the end of the Treatise. Subjoined is a
comparative table of chapters iu the old editions, and
in Welchman’s (who restored the right orderl:
