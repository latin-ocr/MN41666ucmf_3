PREFACE

ΙΤ is nearly two centuries since a separate edition of

Novatian's Treatise on the Trinity was produced by

an English olergyman, John 'Jackson-and published in -
London. To this editor and his immediate predecessor,

Edward Welchman, we are indebted for valuable help

towards the emendation oi a corrupt vulgate text, in -
the absence os all manuscript evidence. But they left

much still to hedone, and the text ol the present edition

can only claim to marl< a further advance towards

textual purity. My first duty was to provide an in·

telligible text, and this, l trust, has been accomplished.

The aim of the Commentary has been to make the

treatise speah for itself. Criticism and theological

dissertation were reservedin the main, for the Intro-

duction.

The interest oi the Treatise, and its importance at
the present day, will hardly be questioned. lt is at once
the earliest systematie treatise on its subject, and the
earliest monument of Roman theology. It transports «
us to a critical period in the history of Christian thought.
