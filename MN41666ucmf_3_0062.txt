position vvill reveal certain points of difference.—Christ
is ‘dominus deus noster, sed dei filius’ (c. ix iaia). It
is not necessary to traverse again the ground already
covered by usin treating ol the Fre-existence of the
Son. But this much may be said here. As He is God
in His origin, He vvas glorified in His personal essence
before the world vas established, and uas vvith God to
receive His command that the world should be created3
and as the Word of God He descended from heaven.

’ On earth, He shevvs that He lmovvs the secrets of man’s

heart, He forgives sins He heals diseases, He assures
man ol immortality and even of divinity¹‚ He is omni-
present to be involed in vvorshipl, and He bestovvs that
enduring salvation which mere man could not give³⁸
If vve allovv that He is Son of God, vve are bound to
confess him Godt. And yet He has Himsell stated
‘on vvhat principle' He is God, namer, ‘as the Son of
God born (natus) of God,’ or, ‘as being the Son, not the
Father! From the crucial passage ln Philippians ii
the writer argues that He never placed Himself on the

same level vvith the Father, ‘remembering that He has q

vvhat He is simply by the Father's gistt’ The Father
is ‘immensus' ie. subject to no local limitations3 the
Son is, or may he, ‘contined in space,' coming, as the
prophet said, from the South, in other words, from
Bethlehem (c, xii, p. 41sq.)⁷. The argument against
the Sabellians requires that this should refer to Him
as God and not merely as Man. .
Again, God the Father is invisible, no human eye can
contemplate Him: He transcende the reach of thought⁸.
