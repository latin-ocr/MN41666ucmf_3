‘personality' is under discussion. It is another matter
to imagine that we 'can get behind these theologica]
terms to the supposed simplicity oi primitive Christianity.
A school of thinkers has attempted to eliminate meta·
physics from theology, and to draw a sharp distinction

between reiigious ‘value—judgments’ and the theoretic
judgments of philosophy. But vno satisfying system of
thought has resulted. Α place must be found for human
reason, beside Revelation and the spiritual and moral
facuities, in any true theology.
