he forgets to analyse the third word in his constant
formula ‘uerbum caro sacremus and prefers to say that
the Word ‘assumes’ Flesh, as though Flesh had'not
been taken into the very Person of the Son of God- lt
is plain that he had not attained to that conception
of the relation between the Natures in the One Person
of Christ, which to later theologians is known as
the ‘communicatio idiomatum' And yet it is surely
evident, from the varied and tentative character of his
terminology, that he is feeling about for the right
phrase to shew that it is neither a transmutation or
disappearance of the human into the Divine‚ nor a
mechanica} juxtaposition of the two. lt is a ‘mystery'
Novatian does not set himself to find any one form of
expression for this mysterious fact, nor to speculate

upon the problem of the Divine Personality which it >

implies. As yet-like the doctrine of the Third Person
of the Trinity—it had not passed from the region of
Christian faith and experiente into that of theological
reflexion.
